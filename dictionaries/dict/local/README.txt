This is a collection of dictionaries and word lists collected
from around the network.  

Where possible, we have indicated the source of a word list by naming
the file after the site where we obtained the list.  In some cases
(like the "names" directory) we have put a separate file indicating the
source and/or contents of a file.

Some of the files here we got through mechanisms we no longer
remember, or through a third party who does not know where the
original came from.

These files are not in any particular format.  You will have to
examine them before use.

If you have any lists that are not in this collection, please let us
know about them.
