<P>
The homepage URL for this wordlists collection is:

<A HREF="http://www.openwall.com/wordlists/">
http://www.openwall.com/wordlists/</A>
<P>
This wordlists collection is a result of processing many hundreds of
public domain wordlist files from multiple sources and in a variety of
file formats.
Most files were rejected for being duplicates or for poor quality,
but a few hundred remained and went into the combined wordlists you
will find here.
<P>
The wordlists are intended primarily for use with password crackers
such as
<A HREF="http://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</A>
and with
<A HREF="http://www.openwall.com/passwords/">password recovery</A>
utilities.
<P>
Included in this collection are wordlists for 20+ human languages
and lists of common passwords.
The included languages are:
Afrikaans,
Croatian,
Czech,
Danish,
Dutch,
English,
Finnish,
French,
German,
Hungarian,
Italian,
Japanese,
Latin,
Norwegian,
Polish,
Russian,
Spanish,
Swahili,
Swedish,
Turkish,
and
Yiddish.
There's also a list of the common passwords and
unique words for all the languages combined in one file
(over 40 MB for almost 4 million entries).
<P>
Included only on the CD and not available in the downloadable version of
the collection is a huge list of all the common passwords and words from
all the languages with word mangling rules applied (to form other likely
passwords, such as by adding capitalization or digits to words) and any
duplicates purged.
This wordlist is provided as a single uncompressed text file usable directly
off the CD.
Its size is almost 500 MB and it has over 40 million entries.
<P>
For all wordlists, the entries are sorted either alphabetically or
for more common to less common passwords/words/languages with alphabetical
order within each section (for about equally common passwords or words, or
for individual languages).
There're no duplicates.
<P>

Five good reasons to
<A HREF="http://www.openwall.com/cgi/redirect.cgi?wordlists-CD-1">
purchase the CD</A>:
<UL>
<LI>You get <B>more content</B>: the huge mangled wordlist is only available on the CD
<LI><B>Immediate access</B> to all of the wordlists:
they're uncompressed and usable right off the CD
<LI>You save <B>time</B>, <B>bandwidth</B>, and <B>hard drive space</B>
<LI><B>You can sleep well</B>
knowing that you've done your part to support the work on this collection
<LI>As a <B>bonus</B>, the CD has a complete mirror of
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.openwall.com/pub/">ftp.openwall.com</A>,
including
<A HREF="http://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</A>
password cracker;
this makes for a total of <B>over 600 MB</B> of content
</UL>
<P>
The wordlists on the CD, except for those found under the included
ftp.openwall.com mirror, are uncompressed DOS/Windows format text files
(lines are terminated with CR-LF pairs).
They are directly usable with most password crackers and
password recovery utilities on both Unix and Windows systems.
Please note that John the Ripper is smart enough to correctly process
(uncompressed) text files even if they use linefeed conventions that
don't match those of the host OS.
<P>
Alternatively, the reduced downloadable version of the collection
is available under /pub/wordlists from the
<A HREF="http://www.openwall.com/mirrors/">FTP mirrors</A>.
<P>
The downloadable wordlist files are in Unix text format
(lines terminated by single LF characters) and compressed
with <A HREF="http://www.gzip.org">gzip</A>.
If you intend to use the wordlists on Windows and not Unix,
you may get them converted to DOS/Windows format text files
(lines terminated with CR-LF pairs) when decompressing.
With <I>gzip</I>, that is achieved with the <I>-a</I> (or <I>--ascii</I>)
command line option.
